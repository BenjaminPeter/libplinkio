This is a small C-library for reading PLINK (genotype) files. 

It will reach 1.0 when the following is implemented:
* Reading PED files (i.e. non-binary bed-files).
* Writing BED files.
* Add a class that wraps python rows, to make the interface simpler.

Project rationales:
* Use C to make it as simple as possible to add bindings
  for other languages.
* Focus only on IO-functionality and speed.
* Few external dependencies to make it easy to use.

This is a small C and Python library for reading Plink genotype files. 

Currently it can:
* Read and parse BED, BIM and FAM files.
* Transpose BED files.

Libplinkio will reach 1.0 when it can:
* Read PED files (i.e. non-binary bed-files).
* Write BED, BIM and FAM files.
* Reading SNPs from Python is almost as fast as directly
  from C (requires using something like array instead of lists).

Project rationales:
* Use C to make it as simple as possible to add bindings
  for other languages.
* Focus only on IO-functionality.
* Few external dependencies to make it easy to use.

See bitbucket wiki for information on how to install and use it.

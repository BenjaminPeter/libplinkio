This is a small C-library for reading PLINK (genotype) files. 

It will reach 1.0 when the following has been implemented:
* Support for PED files.
* Support for all features in PLINKs various file formats.

Project rationale:
* Use C to make it simple to add bindings for other languages.
* Few external dependencies to make it simple to install.
* Only support for *nix since I do not have time to support multiple platforms.

This is a small C-library for reading PLINK (genotype) files. 

It will reach 1.0 when the following has been implemented:
* Reading of the non-binary PED files.
* Writing of BED files.
* Support for all features in PLINKs various file formats.
* Full support for windows.

Project rationale:
* Use C to make it simple to add bindings for other languages,
  so that you can rapidly prototype new GWAS methods.
* Focus on IO-functionality and speed.
* Few external dependencies to make it easy to use.
